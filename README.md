Problem-1: Linear regression
Gem Stones co ltd, is a cubic zirconia manufacturer, which is an inexpensive diamond alternative with many of the same qualities as a diamond. 
They earn different profits on different prize slots of the products. Using a dataset containing the prices and other attributes of
almost 27,000 cubic zirconia, the price for the stone will be predicted, so that the company can distinguish between higher profitable stones and
lower profitable stones so as to have better profit share. Also, the best five attributes that are most crucial to the price prediction process will be
identified.

The client, a tour & travel agency, has supplied data about employees from one of their client companies. In this data, certain employees have
opted for a particular tour package, while certain have not. Based on this data, predications need to be made whether employees in future will opt
